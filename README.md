# encrypt-mail-CSR
This is a simple message encryption module that will directly access the real URL,  
however, this encryption is still in the form of Caesar encryption.

ATTENTION:
the following things must be paid attention to:
1. This module is only used for proper purposes.
2. This module can be run from vscode or terminal just by calling the module, without any additional code
3. We expect users to contribute suggestions and criticism
